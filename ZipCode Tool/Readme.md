For faster sorting of letters, the USPS encourages companies that send large volumes of mail to use a bar code denoting the zip code.  The program utilizes the USPS encoding algorithm to encode a 5-digit zip code into a bar code, as well as decode a bar code back into a five-digit zip code.

The program asks user for a zip code and prints the board code using the colon ":" for half bars and the pipe "|" for full bars.  For example, the author's zip code 10037 becomes |||:::::||:|:::||:::|::||:|. The program is also able to carry out the opposite conversion: Translate bars into the zip code.  

If there are any errors in the input format or a mismatch of the digits, the script reports it.
