Imagine you live on an infinite grid of streets where locations are represented as integer pairs (avenue,street). Negative numbers are okay in this example. Now consider a drunkard that randomly picks one of four directions at an intersection and then stumbles to the next intersection doing the same and so on. 

This script simulates this behavior given the drunkard's initial position.
